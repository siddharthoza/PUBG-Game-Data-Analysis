# Player Unknown's Battle Grounds (PUBG) Game Data Analysis 
> An analysis of Player Unknown's Battle Grounds (PUBG) Game Data using Hive and Spark. The project was done as part of Big Data Analysis class at the University of Texas at Dallas.
The final presentation for the report can be found in [project presentation](https://github.com/siddharthoza/Big Data Project-Group 7- Final.pdf).

## General info

The goal of the study was to learn data analysis using various big data tools. The professor had allowed us to select the dataset of our own choice to analyze.
All the members of our team were a great fan of PUBG mobile game and the game developer had recently released the dataset on Kaggle. So we decided to take it up for our project, that way we also have an analytics edge when playing the game.

## Technologies and Tools
* Hive
* Spark 

## Setup
The data for the analysis has been sourced from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/c/pubg-finish-placement-prediction). 
All the codes used in the analysis can be accessed [here](https://github.com/harshbg/PUBG/tree/master/Code) and can be used to reproduce the result. 
A detailed explanation of the various operations and the interpretations of the outputs can be found in the [project report](https://github.com/harshbg/PUBG/blob/master/Big%20Data%20Project%20-%20Group%207-%20Final.pdf).

## Features
The analysis is focussed on answering questions stated below:
  * Does killing more people increases the chance of winning the game?
  * Can we predict the finishing position of a player in the game?
  * Can we predict the winner of the game?
  * How different/similar are the strategies required to win the game when playing solo, duo, or in a group?
  * How do we catch the cheaters in the game?
  * How does the weapon acquisition strategy differ for players in different clusters?

The answers to the questions can be found in the [report](https://github.com/harshbg/PUBG/blob/master/Big%20Data%20Project%20-%20Group%207-%20Final.pdf).
